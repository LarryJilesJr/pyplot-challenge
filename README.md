This Python script and other data minupulation libraries are used and designed to analyze Pymaceuticals’ 'Drug Regimen' data contained in a CSV dataset. The script calculates key drug treatment data and gives insightful visualizations to provide clarity into the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. A detailed analysis is included within my findings, which can be easily read and shared with other interested parties.

The script uses Python's basic csv module and also utilizes pandas along with JupyterNotebook in order to create DataFrames. Libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stat were used to calculate and decipher the given data files. The DataFrames enhanced my analysis while key visualizations gave me a clearer picture of the underlining data.
